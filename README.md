## Scoring Methodology

**Likelihood (1–5)** estimates frequency (threat activity, exposure, control strength).  
**Impact (1–5)** captures reasonable-worst-case business harm (take the maximum across confidentiality, integrity, availability, regulatory/legal, financial, reputation).  
**Risk Rating** = Likelihood × Impact. Bands: Low (1–5), Moderate (6–10), High (11–15), Critical (16–25).

### Likelihood scale
1 — Rare: ≤ once in 5 years; strong deterrents; no history  
2 — Unlikely: Once every 2–5 years; specific conditions  
3 — Possible: Once per 1–2 years; observed in industry  
4 — Likely: Quarterly–annually; active campaigns; high exposure  
5 — Very likely: Monthly+; widespread exploits; known weakness

### Impact scale
1 — Negligible: No material harm; <1h minor blip; trivial cost  
2 — Low: Small subset; <4h localized outage; <$10k  
3 — Moderate: Noticeable; 4–24h partial outage; $10k–$100k  
4 — High: Major segment; 1–3 days loss or data compromise; $100k–$1M  
5 — Severe/Critical: Enterprise-level; >3 days outage or widespread breach; >$1M; regulatory
